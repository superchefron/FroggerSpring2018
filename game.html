	Project: FlyFrogger

	Group: Justin Little, Nick Jones, Reuel Jacques-Sorrell 
	
	Description: 
		The "game.html" file implements the animation of FlyFrogger after the user presses the "Start" button in the "index.html" file that is a link to the animation.

	Imports: 
		<body background> is implemented to import the "background.png" image as the background image.

		"stylesheet.css" is the .css file that will format both the "index.html" and "game.html files"

		Two fonts are imported from Google - Raleway and Work Sans - that will be implemented in the .css file.



	Multiple divs are created in this file that contain images for the animation.

		The "frog" image is created to meet the flies as they come within range of the flies.

		The "tongue" div/image is created to appear when the frog gets within vicinity of a fly, and to disappear when the frog is NOT near a fly.
