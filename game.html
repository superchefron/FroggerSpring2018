	Project: FlyFrogger

	Group: Justin Little, Nick Jones, Reuel Jacques-Sorrell 
	
	Description: 
		The "game.html" file implements the animation of FlyFrogger after the user presses the "Start" button in the "index.html" file that is a link to the animation.

	Imports: 
		<body background> is implemented to import the "background.png" image as the background image.

		"stylesheet.css" is the .css file that will format both the "index.html" and "game.html files"

		Two fonts are imported from Google - Raleway and Work Sans - that will be implemented in the .css file.



	Multiple divs are created in this file that contain images for the animation.
